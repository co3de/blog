<h3>Introducing co3de</h3>
<h5>December 22, 2016</h5>

<p>Software development is hard.  There need to be tools to make it easier.</p>

<p>The rooms developers work in have whiteboards filled with diagrams that help visualize the software being built.
But why can't we make those diagrams live in the computer, and build the actual software while we're making diagrams?</p>

<p>We believe it's possible.  Not by inventing a new language that everyone has to learn, or making a new modeling tool,
but by a different approach.</p>

<p>We will layer a <i>new kind of visualization</i> on top of existing languages.
Something that draws out all the "connections and effects" to let you see exactly what's going on at a glance.</p>

<p>Our approach will keep the diagram we draw in sync with the code at all times and let you work solely in the code or
solely in the diagram.</p>

<p>Think of how easy it is to navigate a map or arrange photos on an iPad.   We plan to bring the same sensibility to coding and
code navigation.</p>

<p>But better usability and good visualizations aren't solely what makes the iPad so popular, it's when people can communicate
easily that great things become possible, so we will also build better collaboration tools than exist today that let
developers work with each other, with testers and with product owners in more direct ways.</p>

<p>Some keys to our product are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Visibility</b> <p> We will show you everything that matters as you write and debug software so you're never confused about
               what's going on or what just happened.</p>

<li><b>Repeatability</b> <p> We will allow you to re-play almost anything so you aren't left with that sinking feeling of "oh,
                  that last change worked better than this one... now what did I do again?"</p>

<li><b>Automatability</b> <p> We will automate what we can, so that you're spending less time doing "busy work",
                  and more time building great software.</p>
</ul>

<p>The road ahead is long, and we're just getting started, stay tuned for more!</p>
